# Model analysis project

This project investigates the economic growth behavior of two countries, A and B, by applying the **Solow Growth Model**. We aim to provide a comparative analysis of their growth trajectories, identifying key differences and similarities, and offering insights into the factors driving their respective growth patterns and steady state levels

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [modelproject.ipynb](modelproject.ipynb).

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires no further packages.
