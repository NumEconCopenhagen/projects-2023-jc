# Data analysis project

The DataProject will cover analysis on the performance of the APPLE stock over time and compare it to other companies in the same sector (Tech), such as Amazon, Microsoft, IBM and Intel. We will be using graphs and tables to visualize the data and analyze trends and patterns in their stock prices. The purpose of this 'Data' project is to gain a deeper understanding of the tech sector and how different companies have performed over time, and to derive some conclusions. Lastly we  will be working with monthly data in the period January 1. 2000 to March 31 2023 (However in some steps we do delete data from 2023, to make the results more clear) retrieved from Yahoo Finance. 

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [dataproject.ipynb](dataproject.ipynb).

We apply the **following datasets**:

1. APPL.csv (*Yahoo Finance*) 
2. INT.csv (*Yahoo Finance*)
3. IBM.csv (*Yahoo Finance*)
4. MSFT.csv (*Yahoo Finance*)
5. AMZN.csv (*Yahoo Finance*)

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires the following installations:

``pip install matplotlib-venn``
